# renamer
Quickly add a new script to a workflow by automatically renumbering the existing scripts.

## Installation
`devtools::install_github("squartinas/renamer")`

## Description
When files need to be run in sequence it is [good practice][1] to prefix them with numbers. This package makes it easier to add a script to the middle of an existing workflow without the need to manually renumber the all the scripts.
